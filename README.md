Build your own interactive light installation with a projector and a keyboard. 
Try it at http://keybright.net

# story
- In 2012, I created a simple installation called Magic Keyboard (https://vimeo.com/45154003) with vvvv: a Windows-based toolkit. The project was only running on my laptop at the time and wasn't ready to be opened on any device. 
- In 2015, looking back at the project, I felt it would be great to make it available to anyone on earth owning a projector and a keyboard. 
- So I learnt some JS and ported it to the web.

# concept
- Keybright is just a simple tangible interface involving an input (keyboard) and a magical output (light letters with physical behavior).
- It is also a platform where developpers can develop and propose their own games with this unfamiliar input.

- My goal is to build a DIY happy alternative to existing videogames with a physical/digital experience at home rather than just a 16/9 screen.

# this repository
- It holds all the code and files for the web-platform keybright.net.
- It is open to anyone to fork it and improve it, wether it'd be for the core or to add new games.
